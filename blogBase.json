has launched two new models in its Llama 3 series of open generative AI models, Llama 3 8B and Llama 3 70B, which contain 8 billion and 70 billion parameters respectively. The company claims these models, trained on two custom-built 24,000 GPU clusters, are among the best-performing generative AI models available today. The Llama 3 models have outperformed other models such as Mistral\u2019s Mistral 7B and Google\u2019s Gemma 7B on at least nine benchmarks. The larger Llama 3 model, Llama 3 70B, is also competitive with flagship generative AI models, including Google\u2019s Gemini 1.5 Pro. Meta also claims that the new Llama models offer more \"steerability,\" a lower likelihood to refuse to answer questions, and higher accuracy on trivia questions, questions pertaining to history and STEM fields such as engineering and science and general coding recommendations, thanks to a much larger dataset of 15 trillion tokens.\r\n\r\n\r\n### [Boston Dynamics\u2019 Robert Playter on the New Atlas](https://spectrum.ieee.org/atlas-humanoid-robot-ceo-interview)\r\n\r\n![topnews2.webp](https://img2.imgtp.com/2024/04/28/5fmFHIw5.webp)\r\n\r\nIn a recent interview, Boston Dynamics CEO Robert Playter unveiled the new electric Atlas robot, marking a significant shift from their previous hydraulic models towards a commercially viable product. This new Atlas is designed for diverse industrial applications, including handling heavy objects with complex geometries in manufacturing settings. Playter discussed the extensive development process, emphasizing the necessity of understanding the robot's potential industrial applications to ensure its commercial success. Unlike earlier models, this Atlas features advanced electric actuators and an extraordinary range of motion, surpassing human capabilities. Playter highlighted the robot's potential to revolutionize tasks through its strength, flexibility, and efficiency. He also mentioned the design considerations for Atlas's head, focusing on non-humanlike features to make it appear more approachable and communicative.

This system outperforms architectures built on graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs), and is expected to enable real-time continuous learning for AI applications in various fields, including scientific and engineering problem-solving, logistics, smart city infrastructure management, and large language models (LLMs). Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories plan to use Hala Point for advanced brain-scale computing research, focusing on scientific computing problems in device physics, computer architecture, computer science, and informatics.
